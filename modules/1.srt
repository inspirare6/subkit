1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,000
What smells so good

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,200
I provide food this week

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,400
Cooking now?

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,800
Hurry up

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,200
Go to the kitchen to help

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,800
Someone is cooking, who?

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,200
Why are you here

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,200
Look

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,000
Get a clean plate here

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Your kitchen ventilator and recipe

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,800
So good, it's a waste to not use them

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,200
What, don't work in hotel now

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,400
Working as a nanny here?

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Can you afford to hire me

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,400
No nonsense

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Tell me

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,800
How did you piss off my father

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,200
Not feeling good right?

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
Just ask your father

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
Meal time

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
It's your favourite shirmps

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,800
Good

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
It's bought

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,600
Come, have a seat

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
You may not know each other

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,600
Introduce

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200
This is Luo Yue

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,600
Who moved to our opposite house days ago

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,000
Neighbor

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,400
Opposite

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
This is the son I mentioned to you

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Cheng Hao

33
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
You know each other

34
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,600
What a coincidence

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,400
T told you the other day

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,200
Gonna introduce my friend to you

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,800
The dating consultant

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Is him

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,600
It's your son

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Then it's easy

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
That

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,000
You come here

43
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
What

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,600
The meal today

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
Is a trap for me?

46
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,800
I don't want your life

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,000
I told my father my second job

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,600
Is taking my life

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Follow me

50
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,400
What

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,800
Take a look, see

52
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
What

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
You father likes it

54
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,600
The middle on with white clothes

55
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
It most elegant

56
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,800
Aunt Yang

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,600
Was a teacher before

58
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
She is retired now

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,600
Her husband has passed away many years ago

60
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Children are not by her side

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Same as your father

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Wait

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,200
I know what you are up to

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,200
So you want your son

65
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,800
To set up a date for his father

66
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,800
Unbelievable

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,400
Why are you so selfish?

68
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
It's not like

69
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
Getting yourself a step-mother

70
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,800
It's getting a companion

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
For your father

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Save it

73
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,200
Ask yourself

74
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,600
Are you really doing it for him?

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,200
Wanna find troubles for me

76
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,200
It'ok, don't use my father as an excuse

77
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,400
Cheng Hao

78
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,800
I've been here for a month

79
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,400
Live right opposite your house

80
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,200
Why we didn't meet until today?

81
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Because God doesn't want it

82
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,000
Because you seldom come back

83
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
To see your father

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,400
Have you thought that

85
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,200
From getting up to falling asleep

86
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,000
How did he spend his day?

87
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,600
He can't cook

88
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,200
How does he deal with food

89
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,000
He's old

90
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,600
Has no one to talk to

91
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
He finds a person

92
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,000
That he can live with

93
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,800
Nothing wrong about it

94
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
It sounds ok

95
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
But our situation is different

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're not gonna convince me

97
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,400
Since you refuse to help your father

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
Then leave me alone

99
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
It's my business to deal with aunt Yang

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,400
Bye

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,400
She is not the same type as my mother

102
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,000
Father

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm leaving now

104
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
We'll talk later next week

105
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
Answer me

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,200
You gave up being a dentist

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,800
Now a dating consultant

108
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,200
You are wrong

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,200
I'm good at my work

110
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,200
You are outside all day long

111
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,800
It's not right

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
Why not right?

113
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,200
What I'm doing

114
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Is just slash youth

115
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,400
If you have time, energy and skills

116
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
It's ok

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Don't tell me this

118
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
You are a dentist

119
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,800
You rely on your techniques

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,400
Even if you fix shoes for people

121
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
I can understand it

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,400
But setting dates for others?

123
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,800
You are a matchmaker

124
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,800
And you are a male matchmaker

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,200
It's wrong

126
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,800
Matchmaker is superstitious

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,400
I'm study sexual relationship

128
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,800
And psychology

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This is science, different

130
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,000
Bullshit

131
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,400
If it's science

132
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,600
Then in these years

133
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Have you brought home a girl?

134
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,600
No, have you ever

135
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,200
Taken it seriously

136
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,000
You can't solve your own problem

137
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,600
Let alone being a consultant

138
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Are you done

139
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Not done

140
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,600
You don't understand my job

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
It's not so bad like you are saying

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It is

143
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
I didn't solve my own problem

144
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,200
But how many couples

145
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,800
Have I brought together, do you know?

146
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,400
When it comes to love

147
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,200
Someone will never understand

148
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,400
Someone just knows it

149
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Nothing to do with time and amount

150
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,600
You have been with my mother for decades

151
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Did you make it work?

152
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
You don't understand my mother

153
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,400
Let alone women

154
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,800
She is gone

155
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,400
You can't let it go

156
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,800
Because you are guilty

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,800
Shut up

158
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't need your comments

159
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,000
All right

160
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,400
What's wrong with man matchmaker

161
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,800
So long as I can help people

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,200
Then it's a good business

163
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,600
It's not a shame

164
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,200
And

165
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,400
You are so old

166
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
You go out each time

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,400
To find emotional sustenance

168
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,000
It's solving your problem

169
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,400
Then let's be clear

170
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,400
You and aunt Yang

171
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,400
I won't oppose

172
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,200
But I won't agree either

173
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,600
Make your own decision

174
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,800
Cheng Hao didn't piss you off yesterday?

175
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
All these years

176
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
It's me who schools him

177
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,800
It's his first time to

178
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,200
Be mad at me

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,200
Uncle Cheng, I didn't do it on purpose

180
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
I don't blame you

181
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,800
It's still our own business

182
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,600
And he seems doesn't agree

183
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
With me and Yang

184
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,800
Just forget it

185
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,600
Don't

186
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,000
You can't just give up for him

187
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
It's not right

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
7 days a week

189
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,600
168 hours

190
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,000
Cheng Hao stays at home for 3 hours

191
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,600
The rest 165 hours

192
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,600
You're all alone

193
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
What does he do every day

194
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,400
Working, meeting people. Having fun

195
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,800
How can he understand you

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,200
You don't need to care about him

197
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
You can finally find yourself a companion

198
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,800
Look after each other

199
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
How about I raising a dog

200
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,000
But I hate it

201
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,800
Dog is different

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,800
50 to 60 years old

203
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,000
Is life's second spring

204
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,400
You are retired finally

205
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Don't have work's burden

206
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,200
Children are grown up

207
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
You can live for yourself now

208
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,000
Why need a dog

209
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,800
It's not easy

210
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,200
If you really think that way

211
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Your mother remarried then

212
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,200
When you hid in Europe

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,800
I studied abroad alone

214
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
Because my mother remarried

215
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,800
I can plan for myself

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,600
Chinese parents always have

217
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,200
Bad relationship with their children

218
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,400
Because they always

219
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Trapped by blood ties

220
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,000
Bearing unnecessary scarfice

221
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,600
Might as well live for yourself

222
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,600
That's right

223
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,400
Relly easy

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,400
It's easy to talk to you

225
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,400
I and Yang

226
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Can reach the realm

227
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,800
I have thought of it

228
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,600
I tell you

229
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,600
We need

230
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
To understand Yang's interests

231
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,200
From different angles

232
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,600
We don't have dating consultant

233
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,000
It's ok

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,600
So long as we take time

235
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,600
It'll work

236
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,600
I see

237
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,600
Anyway Yang

238
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,800
What

239
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,000
Honestly

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
When did you hang out

241
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
With my father

242
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
What

243
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You thought I moved here on purpose

244
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,200
Coincidence

245
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
What a coincidence

246
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,200
I'm saying

247
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Can you be a bit positive

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,800
If I want to deal with you

249
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,600
I would move to the opposite of your house

250
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
You know what I can do

251
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
But I won't hurt innocents

252
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,600
You care so much about my father

253
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
What are you up to

254
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,000
When I knew he's your father

255
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,000
I giggled

256
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,800
I have one more card against you

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,400
But after I talked to him

258
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,200
I really want to find a step-mother for you

259
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,200
He's not easy

260
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Step-mother for who

261
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,600
You don't know about us

262
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,400
He's not easy

263
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,400
He is just used to yell at my mother

264
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,200
He doesn't talk much

265
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,400
Because I'm not there

266
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
No one would take his abuse

267
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,400
He's not lonely

268
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Are you old

269
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Do you know what it feels like

270
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,800
To be alone

271
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's the biggest punishment for someone

272
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
To grow old alone

273
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Do you think your father is a bad man?

274
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,200
What did it take

275
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
To get a life companion?

276
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,800
Health

277
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
If no accident occurs

278
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
You need to make sure

279
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
She's loyal

280
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,600
You are a dating consultant

281
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,400
You think

282
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,400
You believe in love

283
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,200
I believe in love

284
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,800
But don't believe people

285
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,800
All right

286
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
I will toast to you

287
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,800
I only drink martini

288
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,600
No martini

289
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
My mother

290
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,800
Miss Liu

291
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,200
Was a nurse

292
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,800
Took care of ICU patients

293
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
For years

294
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,800
She told me

295
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
One interesting pheonmenon

296
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Some people recover drom comma

297
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,800
When they wake up

298
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
So long as she's women

299
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
The first question would be

300
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,000
Where is my children and husband, are they ok?

301
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,600
But if he's a man

302
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,400
You know what's the first question?

303
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,400
What

304
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Throw the bedclothes back

305
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,600
Are you talking dirty?

306
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,000
It's real

307
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,400
So men are ok

308
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,400
So are women

309
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,400
Not enough when it's not good

310
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Good

311
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
At least we agree something

312
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,200
In common

313
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,600
A breakthrough

314
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,600
Let's finish and leave

315
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:12,000
I'll help your father
